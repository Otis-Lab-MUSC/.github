# Otis Lab at MUSC

Welcome to the GitHub organization for the Otis Lab, part of the Department of Neuroscience at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) in Charleston, SC.

## About Us

The Otis Lab, led by Dr. James M. Otis, Ph.D., investigates the neurobiological mechanisms underlying appetitive and reward-seeking behaviors. Our research spans adaptive behaviors like foraging to maladaptive ones such as drug-seeking, with a focus on understanding the neural circuits driving these processes. We aim to uncover insights into the brain’s role in neuropsychiatric conditions, including addiction, through cutting-edge neuroscience techniques.

Our interdisciplinary team combines expertise in neuroscience, behavioral analysis, and advanced technology to push the boundaries of discovery in brain function and behavior.

## Research Focus

Our lab’s work centers on:
- **Neural Circuit Mapping**: Using techniques like optogenetics, cre-driven rabies tracing, and two-photon microscopy to identify and manipulate the brain circuits involved in reward-seeking.
- **Behavioral Studies**: Developing custom mouse behavioral assays, including a novel head-fixed drug self-administration model, to study addiction-related behaviors with precision.
- **Cellular Mechanisms**: Employing patch-clamp electrophysiology to explore how neurons and glial cells contribute to reward processing and drug-seeking.

## Projects
